# EDA

## Basic Introduction to Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyzing datasets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods. It helps to understand the data's structure, detect outliers, test underlying assumptions, and identify patterns or relationships.

## Dataset
I have used the Zomato dataset from Kaggle for this analysis. This dataset provides information about various restaurants, including their ratings, types of cuisine, and locations.

## Analysis Performed
- Data Cleaning: Finding the missing values.
- Data Visualization: Visualizing distributions, correlations, and trends using various plots.
- Explored numerical and categorical variables.
- Insights: Extracting meaningful insights from the data to understand the trends in the industry.

## Tools Used
- **Python**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data cleaning and preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For data visualization.

## Conclusion
The EDA process provided valuable insights into the Zomato dataset, highlighting key patterns and trends that can inform further analysis or business decisions.
